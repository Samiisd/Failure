# Game introduction

Almost everyone has played the classic dinosaur running game in Google Chrome,
people have been developing dinosaur games for years but this one is from Google.
For those of you who haven’t, here is a short introduction.

There is a dinosaur over there. A T-Rex to be precise. If you hit the space bar
at this time, the dinosaur game will begin, it is a simple game with an easy
gameplay. You need to dodge the cactus and birds coming from the right-hand
side by using the jump(space key) and duck(down arrow).

As you dodge more and more obstacles, the gameplay gets faster and if you ever
run into one, the game stops and the current high score gets updated.

So that was all you needed to know about the game, now coming to the gameplay.

WHY IS IT EVEN THERE?
Developers working on Google Chrome found that users often get frustrated when
the internet isn’t working. They decided to make a small time killing game for
users to keep them occupied before the internet connection resume, Initially
this was only available on Desktop, however, you can now play this
on Android phones too.

WHY A T-REX DINOSAUR?
So this is a frequently asked question. There are two main reasons cited as to
why Google used a T-Rex.

REASON 1
The first reason for choosing a T-Rex was that a T-Rex has small hands.
This signifies that due to small hands, The T-Rex is unable to reach the internet.
Now you might be wondering that there are other animals who have smaller hands,
but Google seems to be obsessed with dinosaurs. Here, look a dinosaur bone
replica made from a T-Rex’s fossils.

This model rests itself in google’s campus area. so the obsession
with dinosaur seems evident.

REASON 2
Reason 2 doesn’t hold as much ground as the first one. This reason simply
states that if you do not have access to the internet, you are probably living
with the dinosaurs. Since the internet has become one of the most important
needs, not having internet means being cut off from the world and living
as stone age men.
